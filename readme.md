## About the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the **oldest known encryption techniques**, used as early as the **1st century BC** by **Julius Caesar**. It's a **substitution cipher** that works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

For example, shifting `"A"` by 3 gives `"D"`, `"B"` becomes `"E"`, and so on.

> Caesar reportedly used it to protect military communications.

## How It Works

This tool takes your input message and shifts each letter by a number you specify.

-   Letters are rotated through the alphabet.
    
-   Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.
    
-   It supports **both encryption and decryption** using the same logic.
    

## Features

-   Encrypt your message with a custom shift value
    
-   Decrypt a message using the correct shift
    
-   Simple menu-driven terminal interface
    
-   Handles uppercase and lowercase letters
    
-   Ignores special characters and numbers during transformation
    

## Example Usage

pgsql

CopyEdit

`Enter a message to encrypt: Hello World
Enter shift value: 3  Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog` 

yaml

CopyEdit

`Enter a message to decrypt:  Khoor  Zruog  Enter shift value:  3  Decrypted message:  Hello  World` 

# How to Run It

This tool is written in **Python**. To run it:

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
    
3.  Run the file:
    
  Depending on what version of python you are running e.g "python3" or "python" the command varies.

  python3 caesar.py

    
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt messages.
    
> Tip: If you're using an online Python environment or editor like Replit, just paste in the code and hit Run.
