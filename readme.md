
# Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Tool!

Hi! I'm your first encryption tool using the **Caesar Cipher** in Python. If you want to explore classical cryptography, you can read me. If you want to try encrypting and decrypting secret messages, you can run me. Once you've finished using me, you can even expand me into something more advanced!

# About the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the **oldest known encryption techniques**, used as early as the **1st century BC** by **Julius Caesar**. It's a **substitution cipher** that works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

For example, shifting `"A"` by 3 gives `"D"`, `"B"` becomes `"E"`, and so on.

> Caesar reportedly used it to protect military communications.

## How It Works

This tool takes your input message and shifts each letter by a number you specify.

-   Letters are rotated through the alphabet.
    
-   Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.
    
-   It supports **both encryption and decryption** using the same logic.
    

## Features

-   Encrypt your message with a custom shift value
    
-   Decrypt a message using the correct shift
    
-   Simple menu-driven terminal interface
    
-   Handles uppercase and lowercase letters
    
-   Ignores special characters and numbers during transformation
    

## Example Usage

pgsql

CopyEdit

`Enter a message to encrypt: Hello World
Enter shift value: 3  Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog` 

yaml

CopyEdit

`Enter a message to decrypt:  Khoor  Zruog  Enter shift value:  3  Decrypted message:  Hello  World` 

# How to Run It

This tool is written in **Python**. To run it:

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
    
3.  Run the file:
    
    nginx
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `python caesar_cipher_tool.py` 
    
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt messages.
    

> Tip: If you're using an online Python environment or editor like Replit, just paste in the code and hit Run.
