About the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, dating back to the 1st century BC. It was famously used by Julius Caesar to protect military communications.

It works as a substitution cipher, shifting each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number.

Example:

"A" shifted by 3 → "D"

"B" → "E"

"HELLO" → "KHOOR"

How This Tool Works

This program allows you to encrypt or decrypt text with a Caesar Cipher shift of your choice.

Letters are rotated through the alphabet

Non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, numbers) remain unchanged

Supports both encryption and decryption

Handles uppercase and lowercase

Features

Encrypt messages with a custom shift value

Decrypt messages with the correct shift

Menu-driven terminal interface

Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters

Skips special characters and numbers

Example Usage
Enter a message to encrypt: Hello World
Enter shift value: 3

Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog

Enter a message to decrypt: Khoor Zruog
Enter shift value: 3

Decrypted message: Hello World
